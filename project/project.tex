\section{Introduction}

The closest-neighbors Voronoi diagram for a set of points $S \subset \R^2$ partitions the plane into regions where each region has an associated $p \in S$ and
is defined by
\begin{equation*}
  R_p = \{ q \in \R^2 | d(p,q) \leq d(p',q) \text{ for all } p' \in S \} .
\end{equation*}

There are several ways to generalize this concept to give other interesting partitions of the plane. Partitioning into regions defined by sharing the
same $k$ closest points in $S$ gives rise to an order-$k$ Voronoi diagram \cite{aurenhammer_survey}. Another method for producing variations on
Voronoi diagrams is to consider using weighted distance functions. Let $w: S \to \R^+$ be a function that defines the weight of points of $S$. The
weighted Voronoi diagram partitions the plane into regions defined by
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{R}_p = \{ q \in \R^2 | d(p,q) - w(p) \leq d(p',q) - w(p') \text{ for all } p' \in S \}.
\end{equation*}
It is worth noting that $p$ is not necessarily contained in $\tilde{R}_p$ in the weighted case. Unlike the straight-line boundaries of standard
Voronoi diagrams, boundaries between regions in weighted Voronoi diagrams are hyperbolic arcs or straight lines \cite{aurenhammer_additive}.

A geometric object closely related to weighted Voronoi diagrams is the power diagram. Consider a Voronoi diagram where points in $S$ are replaced by
circles with possibly distinct radii. Instead of measuring the distance from a point in the plane to the center of the spheres, measure the distance
along lines tangent to the spheres to points in the plane. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, this is equivalent to measuring distances as $d^2(p,q) -
r^2(p)$ where $S$ contains a circle centered at $p$ of radius $r$. This leads to a partition of the plane into regions defined by
\begin{equation*}
  \overline{R}_p = \{ q \in \R^2 | d^2(p,q) - r^2(p) \leq d^2(p',q) - r^2(p') \}.
\end{equation*}
This is known as the power diagram of $S$.

Power diagrams and additively weighted Voronoi diagrams have various connections to other geometric objects and each other.
Power diagrams are known to have connections to arrangements of hyperplanes in $\R^3$ ($\R^{d+1}$ in general) \cite{aurenhammer_survey}. The notions
of power diagrams and additively weighted Voronoi diagrams can be connected through embeddings of additively weighted Voronoi diagrams into
higher-dimensional power diagrams \cite{aurenhammer_additive}. This same connection holds for other generalized Voronoi diagrams.

\section{Applications of Power Diagrams}

Power diagrams have found applications in many diverse fields. Some of these uses are straightforward applications to computer science problems. Other
applications can be found in constrained clustering, manifold reconstruction, and materials science.

Within computer science, power diagrams give useful algorithms for problems involving discs. One such problem is that of determining whether a point
lies within the union of a set of discs. A problem that arises in computer graphics that power diagrams give a solution to is finding the boundary of
the union of $n$ discs. \cite{imai_power} Another application of power diagrams is determining whether discs within a set of $n$ discs overlaps
\cite{aurenhammer_discs}. Given the $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for computing power diagrams, these problems can all be solved in $O(n \log n)$ time.

Power diagrams also find use in areas outside of algorithms. They can be used in clustering problems in which there are constraints on the way points
can be clustered \cite{brieden_clustering}. One example of this type of problem would be when a small number of farmers own many small plots of land
in the same area. To reduce operating costs, these farmers may agree to reallocate their lots in such a way that their lots are closer together. In
this reallocation process, the farmers are constrained because they need to group plots in such a way that each farmer gets roughly the same acreage
as before the reallocation \cite{brieden_farmland}.

Power diagrams can also be used in manifold reconstruction. This problem takes a sampling of points from a smooth manifold in a higher-dimensional
ambient space. The goal is to give a piecewise linear approximation of the surface of the original manifold. \textbf{I'M NOT SURE HOW POWER DIAGRAMS
ARE BEING USED HERE}.

Power diagrams have also found use in some numerical methods for fluid equations. In simulations of multiple fluids using finite volume methods, cells
may end up containing multiple substances. After materials are located within a cell, power diagrams can be used to give an approximation to the
interface between the substances. This interface approximation allows the materials to be advected properly, leading to more accurate simulations
\cite{fluids}.
