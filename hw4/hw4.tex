    \begin{problem}
      An important special case of the point location problem is when the underlying subdivision is a simple polygon: the answer to a point location
      query here is whether a query point lies inside or outside the polygon. In this case, the query can be answered efficiently using a simpler data
      structure than the one used for general subdivisions.

      Let $P$ be a $n$-vertex simple polygon, with its vertices given in clockwise order in an array. For each of the following cases, describe
      briefly but precisely, in words, how to answer a point location query for a query point $q$ in time $O(\log n)$ using $O(n)$ space. (Pseudocode
      is not needed.) Pre-processing of $P$ is allowed. State any data structure you use.

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $P$ is convex
        \item $P$ is $y$-monotone
        \item $P$ is star-shaped, i.e., there is a point, $r$, inside $P$ from which all points, $s$, inside $P$ are visible along a straight line,
          i.e., the line segment $\overline{rs}$ is contained in $P$. Assume that you are given $r$.
      \end{enumerate}

    \begin{problem}
      Let $S = \{p_1, p_2,\dots, p_n\}$ be a set of $n$ sites (points) in the plane. Let $Vor(S)$ be the Voronoi Diagram of $S$. LEt $B$ be an
      axes-parallel bounding box that is large enough to enclose all the vertices of $Vor(S)$. Assume that the subdivision consisting of $B$ and the
      part of $Vor(S)$ that is inside $B$ has been computed into a DCEL structure. (See the figure on p. 166 for an example of such a subdivision.)
      Assume that each (finite) face of the DCEL also stores the associated site.

      A site $p_j$ is a nearest neighbor of another site $p_i$ if the Euclidean distance between $p_i$ and $p_j$ is no larger than the Euclidean
      distance between $p_i$ and any other site. (Note that $p_i$ can have more than one nearest neighbor. Also note that if $p_j$ is the nearest
      neightbor of $p_i$, then it is not necessary that $p_i$ is the nearest neight of $p_j$.) Computing efficiently the nearest neighbors of each
      site in $S$ is an important problem, with application in clustering, collision avoidance, etc.

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $V(p_i)$ be the Voronoi polygon of $p_i$. Prove that every nearest neighbor of $p_i$ defines an edge of $V(p_i)$. (Note that the
          converse is not necessarily true, i.e. every edge of $V(p_i)$ need not define a nearest neighbor of $p_i$.)

        \item Show how to use $Vor(S)$ and the result in part (a) to compute for each site $p_i \in S$ all of its nearest neighbors. (This implies a
          solution to the closest pair problem on $S$.) The overall running time should be $O(n)$. You may describe your solution in words, but
          please be clear and precise.

     \begin{problem} Ex 9.13, p. 217

       The \emph{Gabriel graph} of a set $P$ of points in the plane is defined as follows: Two points $p$ and $q$ are connected by an edge of the
       Gabriel graph if and only if the disc with diameter $pq$ does not contain any other point of $P$.

       \begin{enumerate}
         \item Prove that $DG(P)$ contains the Gabriel graph of $P$.

         \item
           Prove that $p$ and $q$ are adjacent in the Gabriel graph of $P$ if and only if the Delaunay edge between $p$ and $q$ intersects its dual
           Voronoi edge.

         \item Give an $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm to compute the Gabriel graph of a set of $n$ points.

       \end{enumerate}

     \end{problem}

     \begin{solution}

       \begin{enumerate}
         \item
           Take any edge $e$ in the Gabriel graph. Let $p$ and $q$ be the endpoints of $e$. Then the disc with diameter $pq$ does not contain any
           other point of $P$. Therefore, there is an edge between $p$ and $q$ in the Voronoi diagram of $P$, which implies there is an edge between
           $p$ and $q$ in the Delaunay graph. This holds for any edge in the Gabriel graph, so the Gabriel graph is contained in $DG(P)$.

         \item
           Assume the Delaunay edge between $p$ and $q$ intersects the dual Voronoi edge. Let this intersection point be $r$. Then $r$ is on the
           boundary between $Vor(p)$ and $Vor(q)$. One of the structural properties of Voronoi diagrams listed in class says there is a circle with
           $p$ and $q$ on its boundary with no other sites of $P$ on the boundary or in the interior. $r$ is on the (straight) Delaunay edge between
           $p$ and $q$, so this circle has $pq$ as its diameter. Therefore, $p$ and $q$ are adjacent in the Gabriel graph of $P$.

           Now, assume $p$ and $q$ are adjacent on the Gabriel graph. Then we can draw the disc with diameter $pq$. Let $r$ be the midpoint of the
           line between $p$ and $q$, i.e. $r$ is the center of the disc. The disc contains no sites other than $p$ and $q$ by the definition of the
           Gabriel graph. Therefore, $r$ is on the Voronoi edge between $p$ and $q$. This means $r$ is on the Voronoi edge and the line segment
           between $p$ and $q$, but this line segment is exactly the Delaunay edge between $p$ and $q$. Thus the Voronoi edge and Delaunay edge
           intersect.

         \item
           To construct a Gabriel graph, we can begin by computing the Delaunay graph and the Voronoi diagram. For every edge in the Delaunay graph,
           we take the associated edge in the Voronoi diagram and check if the Voronoi edge and Delaunay edge intersect. If they do, we leave the edge
           in the graph. Otherwise, we remove it. By (a) and (b), this algorithm will return the correct graph.

           Computing the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay graph take $O(n \log n)$ time. We know there are $O(n)$ edges in each, so we can use our
           constant time intersection check to reduce to the Gabriel graph in $O(n)$ time. Combining these steps, we have a run-time of $O(n \log n)$.

       \end{enumerate}
